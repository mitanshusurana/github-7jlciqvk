# Refined Domain-Driven Design Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the refined DDD approach for the comprehensive jewelry and gemstone inventory management system, organizing the 113 data fields across 17 major sections into well-defined domains and bounded contexts.

## Core Domains

### 1. Product Catalog Domain
**Bounded Context**: Product Management
- **Entities**: Product, ProductVariant, ProductCategory
- **Value Objects**: Dimensions, Weight, Quality, Certification
- **Aggregates**: ProductCatalog
- **Services**: ProductCreationService, ProductUpdateService

### 2. Inventory Domain  
**Bounded Context**: Stock Management
- **Entities**: InventoryItem, StockLocation, StockMovement
- **Value Objects**: Quantity, ReorderLevel, Location
- **Aggregates**: Inventory
- **Services**: StockTrackingService, ReorderService

### 3. Gemstone Domain
**Bounded Context**: Gemstone Expertise
- **Entities**: Gemstone, Certification, Origin
- **Value Objects**: CaratWeight, ClarityGrade, ColorGrade, CutGrade
- **Aggregates**: GemstoneCollection
- **Services**: GradingService, CertificationService

### 4. Jewelry Domain
**Bounded Context**: Jewelry Craftsmanship
- **Entities**: JewelryPiece, Metal, Setting
- **Value Objects**: RingSize, MetalPurity, SettingType
- **Aggregates**: JewelryCollection
- **Services**: SizingService, MetalworkService

### 5. Carved Art Domain
**Bounded Context**: Artistic Heritage
- **Entities**: CarvedPiece, Artisan, CulturalSignificance
- **Value Objects**: CarvingStyle, Workmanship, ArtisticPeriod
- **Aggregates**: ArtCollection
- **Services**: AuthenticationService, AppraisalService

### 6. E-commerce Integration Domain
**Bounded Context**: Multi-Platform Sales
- **Entities**: Platform, Listing, SyncStatus
- **Value Objects**: PlatformId, ListingStatus, SEOData
- **Aggregates**: PlatformIntegration
- **Services**: SyncService, ListingService

### 7. Financial Domain
**Bounded Context**: Business Operations
- **Entities**: Transaction, Pricing, Cost
- **Value Objects**: Money, TaxRate, Markup
- **Aggregates**: FinancialRecord
- **Services**: PricingService, CostCalculationService

### 8. Customer Domain
**Bounded Context**: Client Relationships
- **Entities**: Customer, Order, Reservation
- **Value Objects**: ContactInfo, Address, OrderStatus
- **Aggregates**: CustomerProfile
- **Services**: OrderService, ReservationService

## Domain Integration Patterns

### Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)
Protects domain integrity when integrating with external systems:
- Shopify API ACL
- Etsy API ACL  
- eBay API ACL
- Payment Gateway ACL

### Domain Events
Cross-domain communication through events:
- ProductCreated
- InventoryLevelChanged
- OrderPlaced
- PlatformSyncRequested

### Shared Kernel
Common concepts shared across domains:
- Identity (UUID patterns)
- Audit Trail
- Money/Currency
- DateTime handling

## Bounded Context Map

```
[Product Catalog] ←→ [Inventory] ←→ [E-commerce Integration]
       ↓                ↓                    ↓
[Gemstone] ←→ [Jewelry] ←→ [Carved Art] ←→ [Financial]
       ↓                ↓                    ↓
[Customer] ←→ [Orders] ←→ [Analytics] ←→ [Audit]
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Domain Layer Structure
```
src/domains/
├── shared/           # Shared kernel
├── product-catalog/  # Product management
├── inventory/        # Stock management  
├── gemstone/        # Gemstone expertise
├── jewelry/         # Jewelry craftsmanship
├── carved-art/      # Artistic heritage
├── ecommerce/       # Platform integration
├── financial/       # Business operations
└── customer/        # Client relationships
```

### 2. Aggregate Design Principles
- Single responsibility per aggregate
- Consistency boundaries align with business rules
- Event-driven state changes
- Optimistic concurrency control

### 3. Repository Pattern
- Interface segregation per aggregate
- Technology-agnostic data access
- Query optimization for complex jewelry searches
- Caching strategies for high-performance lookups

### 4. Domain Services
- Encapsulate complex business logic
- Coordinate between aggregates
- Handle external integrations
- Maintain domain rule consistency

## Technology Alignment

### Database Design
- Aggregate-per-table for core entities
- Event store for audit trails
- Read models for complex queries
- Full-text search for product discovery

### API Design
- RESTful APIs per bounded context
- GraphQL for complex queries
- Event-driven webhooks
- Platform-specific adapters

### Caching Strategy
- Domain-aware cache invalidation
- Multi-level caching (L1: memory, L2: Redis)
- Cache-aside pattern for expensive operations
- Event-driven cache updates

## Quality Attributes

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling per domain
- Database sharding by aggregate
- Microservice deployment options
- CDN for media assets

### Maintainability
- Clear domain boundaries
- Testable business logic
- Documentation-driven development
- Code generation for repetitive patterns

### Security
- Domain-level authorization
- Audit trails per aggregate
- Data encryption for sensitive fields
- GDPR compliance patterns

### Performance
- Query optimization per domain
- Lazy loading strategies
- Background processing for integrations
- Real-time updates via WebSockets

This refined DDD approach provides a solid foundation for building a robust, scalable, and maintainable jewelry inventory management system that can handle the complexity of your business requirements.
